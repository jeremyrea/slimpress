#About staticbrace.com

This blog is powered by [Octopress](http://www.octopress.org), a static blogging engine built as a framework for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).  The files are self-hosted and articles are written in Markdown on a local machine, then rsync'ed to the server.

The theme used is called [slimpress](https://github.com/jeremyrea/slimpress) and is custom built, inspired mainly by two other themes.  You can use it for yourself or download the files and modify it to your liking.  The link above will bring you to the github page, which contains instructions on how to download & install the theme in your octopress environment.
